# twitch-notifications

Simple IRC client that does nothing but send you a notification when your name or another word/phrase/regex is said.

This is meant for use with Twitch chat. It might or might not work on other IRC servers, as it's not a bouncer or a proxy. The server must support multiple IRC instances logging in with the same username.

Supported notification services:

* Webhook/HTTP POST
* Telegram (planned)
